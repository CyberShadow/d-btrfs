btrfs API for D
===============

This package contains low-level definitions for querying BTRFS filesystems on Linux, as well as some high-level wrappers for a few operations.

The low-level code is mostly a direct port of the C definitions from [btrfs-progs](https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs).

The high-level wrappers can be found in `btrfs/package.d`.
